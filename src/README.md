# Data Generation & Validation

This folder contains the Python code used to generate and validate the synthetic B2B SaaS data used in the analysis.

The purpose of this code is to ensure the dataset reflects realistic product usage patterns while allowing full control over lifecycle events, collaboration timing, and behavioral variation.

It also includes statistical validation scripts used to confirm that observed differences in behavior are meaningful, not incidental.

These scripts support the analysis but are not the focus of the case study.
