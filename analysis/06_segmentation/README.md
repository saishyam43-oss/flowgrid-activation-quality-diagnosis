# Step 6 – Segmentation: Is the Activation Problem Universal?

## Question
Is activation failure concentrated in specific customer segments, or is it a universal product issue?

## Segments Analyzed
Accounts were segmented by company size:
- SMB
- Mid-Market
- Enterprise

## Results

| Segment | Aha Rate | Aha → Multi-user Rate | Habit Rate |
|-------|----------|----------------------|------------|
| SMB | 12.2% | 4.1% | 0.3% |
| Mid-Market | 13.2% | 1.7% | 0.1% |
| Enterprise | 11.1% | 4.5% | 0.3% |

## Insight
While minor differences exist in Aha and collaboration rates across segments, Habit formation remains uniformly low across SMB, Mid-Market, and Enterprise accounts.

The largest drop-off (Aha → Multi-user) is severe in every segment, indicating that activation failure is not driven by customer size or market tier.

## Decision Implication
Segment-specific onboarding or pricing changes are unlikely to materially improve activation. The primary activation bottleneck—converting individual value into collaborative usage—is a universal product issue that requires a core workflow or onboarding intervention.
