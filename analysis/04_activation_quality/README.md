# Step 4 – Activation Quality Score Validation

## Question
Does the Activation Quality Score (AQS) meaningfully separate real activation from superficial activation?

## Method
AQS was evaluated only for accounts that reached Aha.  
Accounts were bucketed into activation quality tiers and compared against Habit formation.

Low-quality activation was expected to be rare, since Aha itself enforces a strict event sequence.

## Results

| AQS Bucket | Accounts | Habitual Accounts | Habit Rate |
|----------|---------|-------------------|------------|
| Mid AQS | 299 | 0 | 0.0 |
| High AQS | 10 | 6 | 60.0% |

No accounts with AQS = 0 or NULL were present among Aha-qualified accounts.

## Insight
Activation Quality Score strongly separates downstream outcomes.  
Moderate activation quality does not lead to Habit formation, while high activation quality is highly predictive of success.

This confirms that Aha alone is insufficient. The depth, sequencing, and collaboration quality captured by AQS determine whether activation compounds into sustained usage.

## Decision Implication
Improving the Aha rate without increasing activation quality will not improve retention. Product interventions should focus on increasing the proportion of accounts achieving high-quality activation, not merely reaching Aha.
